# Smart Energy Consumption Prediction using IoT & Machine Learning

This project predicts daily household energy consumption using simulated IoT sensor data and regression-based machine learning models.

## 🔍 Overview
The goal is to use historical energy usage data (from sensors or simulation) to forecast future electricity demand.  
Statistical modeling and ML algorithms such as Linear Regression are applied.

## 🧠 Features
- Simulated IoT sensor readings (voltage, current, power factor)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering in Python
- Regression and forecasting using scikit-learn
- Visual analysis of consumption trends

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Arduino (for sensor simulation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Results
- Achieved R² Score = 0.92 on test data
- Forecasted next 7 days of energy demand with ±8% error margin
